# My_Train_Chatbot
The objective of the MyTrain Chatbot project is to develop an AI-powered chatbot that facilitates users in accessing Indian train time table information. 
The chatbot prompts the users for input regarding the "from" and "to" locations in multiple regional languages, as well as their seat/coach preferences (Optional), through text or audio inputs. 
Based on this input, the chatbot retrieves and display all available trains on that route.
